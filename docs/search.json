    "text": "Introduction\nMaintaining visual line of sight (VLOS) of a drone is a fundamental requirement under 14 CFR Part 107, which governs the commercial use of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) in the United States. According to these regulations, drone pilots (or their visual observers) must always be able to see their aircraft unaided by any device other than corrective lenses. This requirement serves as a critical safety measure: by keeping the drone in sight, operators can better avoid collisions with buildings, power lines, or other aircraft, and can respond more quickly to unexpected events or emergencies.\nIn practical terms, “visual line of sight” means that the operator or observer can clearly identify the drone’s orientation and location in real time. While this may sound straightforward, factors such as distance, weather conditions, obstacles, and lighting can all compromise VLOS. Consequently, ensuring VLOS compliance across varying operational scenarios is not always a simple task.\nDespite its importance, relatively little research has been dedicated to developing systematic methods to estimate or verify VLOS. Most current industry practices rely on manual observation and conservative flight planning to ensure the drone remains within sight, but these approaches can be subjective and prone to human error.\n\n\n\nAn example of for a multi-rotor drone (Autel Evo II v3) and a fixed-wing drone (AgEagle eBee) can be found below. A third panel provides the user with an interactive UI to enter in an arbitrary drone size and type for analysis.\n\nAutel Evo II v3 ExampleAgEagle eBee ExampleInteractive Example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the EASA guidelines suggest a max visibility range of 601 ft, the use of visual acuity presents a recommended distance of no more than 850 ft with the limit of the average human’s vision at 1970 ft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variation is significant when comparing results for fixed-wing UAS. The EASA guidelines suggest a max visibility range of 1965 ft, the use of visual acuity presents a recommended distance of no more than 1482 ft with the limit of the average human’s vision at 2952 ft.\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Vertical (inches):\n    \n    Enter the vertical height of the drone in inches.\n  \n\n  \n     Horizontal (inches):\n    \n    Enter the horizontal width or length of the drone in inches.\n  \n\n  \n     Drone Type:\n    \n      Multirotor (default)\n      Fixed-Wing\n    \n    Select the type of drone."

    "text": "Proposed Thresholds based on Angle Subtended by Visual Plane of Drone\nA core principle in assessing the maximum range at which an unmanned aircraft can be visually tracked is the concept of visual acuity, often approximated as the ability to distinguish details that subtend an angle of roughly one arc minute (1/60 of a degree, or 00° 01′ 00″) at the eye. Under standard conditions, an individual with “normal” vision (commonly referred to as 20/20 in the United States) can discern details at this resolution. For an individual with “normal” vision, the height of every letter on the Snellen Eye Chart (Figure 2) on the 20/20 row corresponds to 5 arc minutes (5′) when viewed at 20 ft. The angle subtended by the opening of the letter C to differentiate between the letter O is drawn to be exactly one arc minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Diagram of Snellen Acuity\n\n\n\nHowever, drone operations require not only detection of the aircraft as a point in space, but also recognition of its orientation and possible identification of flight-critical details (e.g., changes in attitude or lights). To incorporate both practical and safety considerations, we propose the following angular thresholds:\n\n1′ - Limit3′ - Max VLOS6′ - Safe VLOS\n\n\nThis is the conventional “benchmark” for human visual acuity in ideal conditions. If a drone appears smaller than this angular size, the average observer will struggle to distinguish it from the background or discern fine details such as its orientation.\n\n\nRecognizing that real-world conditions (e.g., lighting, contrast, visual distractions) are rarely ideal, our model sets 3 arc minutes as the angular size at which the drone can be more reliably perceived and tracked. At this threshold, observers should be able to identify major orientation changes (e.g., a significant turn, climb, or descent), aiding compliance with visual line of sight (VLOS) requirements.\n\n\nFor critical safety operations or scenarios where the observer must rapidly respond to any change in flight status, 6 arc minutes is proposed as a practical “comfort zone.” At this size, not only is the drone’s presence and orientation clearly visible, but there is also additional margin for environmental variables (such as glare, haze, or partial obstructions)."
